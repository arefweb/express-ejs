## Express.js with EJS Template engine

 [**EJS**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) template engine allows us to write JavaScript code inside HTML like files, as well as including different sections inside our HTML. So you can have a home page that includes its header and footer from other template files. 
 This project has been built with express and you can find the sample code inside server.js and corresponding routes like home.ejs .
